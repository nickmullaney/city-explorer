**Author**: Nick Mullaney
**Version**: 1.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application is intended for the user to be able to search for city and find out lots of different information about that city. everything from the weather to events and top ten restaurants are what we're aiming for

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
for this we're using several different coding languages as well as different libraries. we are using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Bootstrap alongside LocationIQ, ___. this application works by making a call to any of our libraries trying to pull down the relevant information and we'll populate the user's screen with all types of information from various libraries
